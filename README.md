Simple graph maker using Sigma.js library.  </br>   
There are a few functionalities related to graph theory. </br> </br>
In the first tab you choose the number of nodes and the connections between them (edges):

You can also check if graph has a Hamiltonian cycle, and make breadth-first search (BFS).  
Additionally, application displays information about the graph, such as the degrees of each nodes and an adjacency list.
